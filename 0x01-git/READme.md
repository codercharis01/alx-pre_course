 i was told to ensure i write a non empty readme file. 
i have a lways been so curious about github.. one time i did a research, but it was lheaded no where
 iam so ecited about the opportunity to create a repository on github.. this is so cool
i observed the commands are quite easy , but it is quite overwhelming.. i am guessing it is because i am just starting
